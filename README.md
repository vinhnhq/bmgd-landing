## Getting Started (Local Development)

1. **Install dependencies** (requires Node >= 18 or Bun >= 1.0):

   ```bash
   bun install           # preferred (fast)
   # or
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the dev server**:

   ```bash
   bun run dev           # or: npm run dev
   ```

   Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.

3. A local SQLite file `bmgd-dev.db` is created automatically in the project root.
   To use a custom path, set the `DB_PATH` environment variable.

## Available Scripts

| Script            | Purpose                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`             | Start development server with hot-reload           |
| `build`           | Build the production bundle                        |
| `start`           | Start the built app (needs `build` first)          |
| `lint`            | Run Biome linter                                   |
| `format`          | Format code using Biome                            |

Run with `bun run <script>` or `npm run <script>` depending on your package manager.

## Environment Variables

| Variable  | Default           | Description                                   |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `DB_PATH` | `bmgd-dev.db` (dev) / `bmgd-prod.db` (prod) | Absolute/relative path to SQLite DB file |
| `NODE_ENV`| `development`     | Switches DB default path & enables dev mode   |

Create a `.env.local` file to override variables locally.
Copy `env.sample` to `.env.local` (or `.env.production`) and adjust the values as needed.

---

## Database Migrations

Tables are created automatically on first access using SQL defined in `src/db/schema/**`.
If you need to reset the database, simply delete the `.db` file ‚Äì it will be recreated.

---

## Docker Usage

1. **Build & run the container locally**:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   # App available at http://localhost:3100
   ```

2. **Publish to Docker Hub** (requires login):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-and-push.sh
   ```

The production image is based on `oven/bun` and exposes port **3000** by default.

---

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker or Node/Bun runtimes, e.g.:

- Vercel (recommended for Next.js)
- Render, Fly.io, Railway
- Self-hosted via Docker/Kubernetes
